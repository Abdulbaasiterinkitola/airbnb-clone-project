2. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. Redis: Used for caching and session management.
7. Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design
Key Entities
1. Users
- id: Primary key
- name: Full name
- email: Unique email address
- password: Hashed password
- role: User role (guest/host/admin)

2. Properties
- id: Primary key
- user_id: Foreign key ‚Üí Users (host who owns the property)
- title: Property title
- description: Property details
- price_per_night: Price of booking

3. Bookings
- id: Primary key
- user_id: Foreign key ‚Üí Users (guest who booked)
- property_id: Foreign key ‚Üí Properties
- check_in: Start date
- check_out: End date

4. Payments
- id: Primary key
- booking_id: Foreign key ‚Üí Bookings
- amount: Payment amount
- status: Payment status (pending/completed)
- transaction_date: Date of payment

5. Reviews

- A Review belongs to both a User and a Property.
  
## üîí API Security Overview
### Key Security Measures
- Authentication: JWT-based login to secure user access.
- Authorization: Role-based access control (guest, host, admin).
- Rate Limiting: Protect against abuse by limiting requests.
- Data Encryption: Store passwords hashed, secure payment details.
- Input Validation: Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
### Why Security Matters
- User Data Protection: Safeguards personal details (emails, passwords).
- Payment Security: Ensures financial transactions are secure.
- System Integrity: Prevents malicious access and abuse.
- Fair Access: Rate limiting stops bots and DDoS attacks.

## ‚ö° CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD means Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates testing, building, and deployment of the backend, and ensures faster delivery.

### Importance
- Automatic testing on every code change.
- Faster deployments with minimal downtime.
- Consistent environments using Docker.
- Early detection of bugs.
### Tools
- GitHub Actions: Automate builds, tests, deployments.
- Docker: Containerize the backend for consistent environments.
- PostgreSQL in Docker: Run database in pipelines.
- Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean: Deployment platforms.
